# Executive Summary — E-commerce Sales & Retention

**Period analyzed:** Jan 2023 – Aug 2025  
**Data sources:** Synthetic transactional + customer data generated for this project.

## Key Findings
- Revenue grew by __% MoM (last 6 months).  
- Top 20% customers contribute ~__% of revenue.  
- __ category leads with __% share; fastest-growing subcategory: __.  
- __% customers are at churn risk (90+ days inactivity), representing __% of revenue.

## Recommendations
1) Launch loyalty offers for high-value churners (tiered discounts, early access).  
2) Shift ad spend to best-performing categories/geos; pause low-ROI segments.  
3) Cross-sell to frequent buyers using subcategory affinities.  
4) Monitor inventory for top subcategories to prevent stockouts.

## Methodology
- **RFM:** Recency (days since last purchase), Frequency (orders), Monetary (revenue). Quantile scoring (1–5).  
- **Churn rule:** `Recency > 90 days` flagged as churn candidate.  
- **Data caveats:** Synthetic but realistic; minor noise added for seasonality and promotions.
